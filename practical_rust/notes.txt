Rustup installs th compiler,cargo,standard lib and other tools
all these tools are availabel in mutiple flvours called ttoolchain 
whihc is combination of release channel and host 
and optiuonally has an assoiciated archive date


two basic ttypes of rust proects
1)Libraries
pieces of code intended for use by other programs,intention is toolsuse up work done by other devlopers for solving a featuer
itts also called lib crate
program executtion for library caret begins at src/lib.rs 


2) Binaries:
sttandalone program tthatt executes which might download something
called bin create tthe execution starts at main() in src/main.rs

Rust heirechy of code org
1)Function
2) Module  - code within module has its own namespace,contains useer defined types,other module imports
function sdecalrations
multiple modules can be defined wihtin simple source file or a module can contain source codes
spread across multiple files.

3) Crates - multipl mouddles are organized intto crates,serves as unit of code sharing acrossrust projects
a crate is eithe rlibrary or binary

4) Packages: multiple crates can be comhbined into pacjkge,a package can contain>x multipl ebinary but only one lib crate
packages contain cargo.toml files 


5) Workspaceas: multiple pacakges can be used in a workspace

cargo default register is crates.oio we can change that to inlcued another registertry from whihc packages can 
be downloaded,think if it as like a collcetion office
